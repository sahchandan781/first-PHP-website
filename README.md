4. Configure the database connection settings in the PHP files (e.g., config.php).

5. Open the project directory with your preferred web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) or use PHP's built-in server:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000

6. Access the website in your web browser at http://localhost:8000.
